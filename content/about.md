title = "About Me"
+++

I'm a Software Engineer interested in sustainability and cloud-native infrastructure. I'm an advisor on Infrastructure at [Green Web Foundation](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/) and a member of the [Green Software Foundation](https://greensoftware.foundation/). I'm also a member of the [ClimateAction.tech](https://climateaction.tech/) community and you can find me there in the `#greener-infra` channel.

From 2017 to April 2022 I was a platform engineer at [Giant Swarm](https://giantswarm.io) working mainly on CI/CD and their app platform. Prior to that from 2015 to 2017 I was a Co-Founder and Chief Software Architect at Microscaling Systems. A startup working on autoscaling containers to reduce costs and carbon emissions.   

Right now I'm taking a mini-sabbatical to travel and work on green software.
