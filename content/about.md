+++

I'm a Software Engineer interested in green software, cloud-native infrastructure and serverless architectures. I'm an advisor on infrastructure at the [Green Web Foundation](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/). I'm also a member of the [ClimateAction.tech](https://climateaction.tech/) community and you can find me there in the `#greener-infra` channel.

I'm currently a Platform Engineer at [FlatPeak](https://www.flatpeak.energy/) who provide tariff, carbon intensity and grid load data to smart devices like EV chargers. From 2017 to April 2022 I was a Platform Engineer at [Giant Swarm](https://giantswarm.io) working mainly on CI/CD and their app platform. Prior to that from 2015 to 2017 I was a Co-Founder and Chief Software Architect at [Microscaling Systems](https://web.archive.org/web/20161013114349/http://microscaling.com/). A startup working on autoscaling containers to reduce costs and carbon emissions.
